Unlabelled saliva swaps
1.	Transfer swabs into an Eppendorf tube containing 200 ul of lysis buffer (1 % sodium dodecyl carbonate (v/v), 10 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, 40 mM 2-chloroacetamide, 100 mM Tris buffer pH 8.5),
2.	Squeeze swabs against the inner wall of the Eppendorf tube thoroughly, then remove swab
3.	Add 0.4 ug of trypsin and LysC to sample-lysis buffer mix and incubate for 60 min at 37°C while shaking
4.	Acidify peptides by adding 1% TFA (v/v) and load sample onto a SDB-RPS StageTip
5.	Centrifuge at 2 600 rpm for 5 min
6.	Wash tips with 30 ul of 0.1% formic acid in water by centrifuging at 2 600 rpm for 3 min
7.	Wash tips with 30 ul of 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile by centrifuging at 2 600 rpm for 3 min
8.	Wash tips again with 30 ul of 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile by centrifuging at 2 600 rpm for 3 min
9.	Elute peptides with 60 ul 80% acetonitrile (v/v) and 1 % ammonium (v/v)
10.	Dry sample in a SpeedVac concentrator, then resuspend in 2 % acetonitrile (v/v) and 0.1% TFA (v/v) to a concentration of 1 g/l
