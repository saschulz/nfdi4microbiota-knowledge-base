Viral PEG purification 
1.	Add 30 ml of ice cold PBS to 3 g of faecal sample and mix by vortexing at high speed for 5 min, then keep on ice
2.	Centrifuge sample at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and transfer the supernatant to a clean 50 ml centrifuge tube
3.	Filter the supernatant through a 0.45 μm syringe filter
4.	Add 10 % 10% w/v PEG-8000 in saline (0.5 M NaCl) to filtrate, mix by inverting and incubate at 4°C overnight
5.	Centrifuge sample at 5000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C and discard the supernatant. 
6.	Re-suspend pellet in 200 μl PBS and transfer it to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube
7.	Add an equal volume of chloroform to the sample and mix gently before centrifuging it at 2500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature
8.	Transfer the aqueous phase into a new and sterile 1.5 ml tube
9.	Add 40 μl of 10 mM CaCl2 and 50 mM MgCl2 to the sample, as well as 10 U of DNase and 10 U of RNase A
10.	Incubate samples at 37°C for 2 h and then place them in a heatblock at 70°C for 10 min
11.	Store at 4°C
