General Protein Storage{% cite <Ruocco_2021> %}
For short-term storage (~24h), most proteins can be kept at 4°C. For long-term storage, protein samples are typically kept at -20°C or -80°C.
Protein storage at -20°C usually requires the addition of 50% glycerol to your sample to avoid freezing at this temperature. If we plan to store a protein at -20°C, we generally run the final size exclusion chromatography step in 2x storage buffer and then dilute the sample 1:1 with 100% glycerol. Alternatively, the protein sample can also be dialysed against the storage buffer already containing 50% glycerol. Proteins stored at -20ºC are often stable for several months, although the exact time frame is protein-dependent and should be determined experimentally.
Protein samples stored at -80ºC will be frozen. As repeated freeze-thaw cycles usually have a negative influence on protein samples, it is best to prepare small-sized, single-use aliquots that will be used up during the course of an experiment. 5-10% glycerol or other additives that protect against the effect of freezing and thawing can be added as well. After preparing your protein sample aliquots, it is important to flash-freeze them in liquid nitrogen before importing them into the -80ºC freezer for long-term storage. Many proteins are stable for months to years when stored under appropriate conditions at -80°C, but the exact time frame varies from protein to protein and should be determined experimentally.

Invertebrates19 – whole samples are stored in 80 % ethanol, in fridge for short-term storage, and in -20°C freezer for long-term storage.

Hooded seal brain19 – whole samples are placed in 4°C glucose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) saturated with 95 % O2 - 5 % CO2. After experiment (induced normoxia and hypoxia), tissues were stored in RNAlater stabilisation fluid (Life Technologies, USA) and kept at 4°C.

Saliva20 - passive drooling procedure in sterile 50 ml screw top tubes (approximately 3 ml of saliva per sample). About 30 minutes before collection, all volunteers performed a mouth rinse with drinking water. Samples were vortexed before 2 ml of each was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 minutes to collected the bacterial pellets. Total DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio), according to manufacturer’s instructions. DNA was stored at −20 °C until used.

Skin swab20 - Skin samples were collected using Catch-All-Swabs (Epicentre Technologies, Wisconsin, USA) shortly after birth but before the skin-to-skin contact with the infant, by swabbing the upper area of the maternal breast (intermammary cleft). After pre-moistening with 2 ml SCF-1 buffer (50 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.6, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.5% Tween-20) (Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012) contained in a 15 ml sterile screw top collection tube (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany), the swab head was rubbed back and forth for approximately 30 seconds over the area (repeating twice) before the swab was returned to the buffered solution. The lower part of the swab was broken to ensure closure of the tube (see below). After sampling, deterge the sampled area with a clean pad of cotton and water. 










Vaginal swabs20 - Skin samples were collected using Catch-All-Swabs (Epicentre Technologies, Wisconsin, USA). The swab was rubbed 5 times, with a circular motion, in the vaginal introitus and then the swab head was placed in a 15 ml sterile screw top collection tube containing 2 ml SCF-1 buffer (see photos above).

Tongue dorsum swabs20 – Skin samples were collected using Catch-All-Swabs (Epicentre Technologies, Wisconsin, USA). Samples were collected by rubbing a swab on the central area of the back of the tongue for approximately 5 seconds. The swab head was then placed in a 15 ml collection tube containing 2 ml SCF-1 buffer (see photos above). Samples were collected while wearing protective disposable gloves to avoid skin contamination. 

Maternal Milk (without glycerol)20
Minimum of 2ml of milk was self-collected by the mothers in sterile falcon tubes while wearing disposable gloves. No buffer was added. Samples were stored at -4C right after collection and moved to -80C within a week. Note that for colostrum and other milk samples within the first week of life the 2ml min quantity might not be possible. In that case, the mother collected whatever quantity was possible in 10 min timespan. 

Maternal Milk (with glycerol)20
Minimum of 2ml of milk was self-collected by the mothers in sterile falcon tubes with added 20% glycerol while wearing disposable gloves. Samples without were stored at -20C for cultivation experiments. Note that for colostrum and other milk samples within the first week of life the 2ml min quantity might not be possible. In that case, the mother collected whatever quantity was possible in 10 min timespan.

Stool samples20 – samples were self-collected using collection tubes specific for faecal material (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Toilet paper was placed at the bottom of the WC, to prevent stool samples from sinking and getting contaminated. The collection was performed at the upper part of the feces, the one not in contact with the toilet paper, WC walls or other material. Subjects were instructed, whenever possible, to urinate before evacuating the stools. Samples were collected in variable quantity, depending on availability (meconium is usually only one spoon). Once collected the tube was placed at -4C as soon as possible, and then transferred to -80C within a week.  







Faeces/gut content21 – flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C (dissolve in Stool DNA Stabilizer (INVITEK Molecular) while thawing; or if you have more time dissolve in Stool DNA Stabilizer right after collection and normally freeze and store at -80°C)
