Viral purification from faecal sample
1.	Homogenise 200 mg of faecal sample in 30 ml of SM buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4)
2.	Centrifuge sample at 4000 rpm for 20 min, then filter through a 0.2 μm filter
3.	Add filtrate to a 100-kDa-molecular-mass Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter
4.	Centrifuge filter tube at 4000 rpm for 3 min to concentrate sample
5.	Repeat centrifugation until the entire diluted filtrate has been passed through the filter tube
6.	Dilute filtrate with 30 ml SM buffer 
7.	Add diluted filtrate to a fresh 100-kDa-molecular-mass Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter
8.	Repeat centrifugation until a filtrate volume of at least 500 μl is reached
9.	Add 10 U of DNase I and 10 U of RNase to the filtrate and incubate at 37°C for 30 min
10.	Incubate samples at 65°C for 15 min to inactivate enzymes
11.	Store at 4°C
